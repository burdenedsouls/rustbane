<br>
The [[Lore/Setting\|Setting]] is space, the dark and dirty corner of a galaxy. The sector where you can get what you want for cheap, if you don't mind it being second hand and it possibly not working. 
<br>
The [[Crew/Crew\|Crew]] is the team the pilots and runs the [[Lore/(Ship) The Rustbane\|(Ship) The Rustbane]], a general space-ship capable of traversing the regions of space for various jobs and missions. They are issued [[Items/Weapons\|Weapons]], [[Items/Tools\|Tools]], and [[Items/Armor\|Armor]] to take on any challenge as they appear.
